## Chatbots

AI chatbots at the moment are pretty dull. There are a few exceptions, very few including the not so well-known [t3.chat](https://t3.chat) is one of them. Talking of t3.chat, I still can't get over the value considering it costs me 6 pounds a mont, 1500 mesages is huge and I get all the decent models including the gemini ones which I quite like and many others. The one thing, that annoys me about it is the lack of MCP support, which I will cover later. I would like the contexts of docs inside my chats. Despite a potenial lack of features, web search is limited  to gemini models and there are no _connections_ like tools to exteneral services, image generation is only gpt image and there isn't MCP support.

## Models

They are being rapidly being developed and it feels like a new model comes out everyday - almost. The advacements in code are massive, I remeber using gpt 3.5 turbo to generate hardly functional html code.

## MCP

AI can generate text, images, audio and even video. But they have **zero** intergration with other tools. This is where MCP comes in
